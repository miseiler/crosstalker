Crosstalker v 0.1

Crosstalker is designed as a simple implementation of the workflow described in
M Seiler, F Tian, Y Liu, Z Hu. Subtype-specific pathway crosstalk in breast cancer. 2014. Submitted.

It is linux command line based, and requires only Python 2.7 and a recent version of Numpy (>= 1.1.0) to run. It is distributed
with a complete implementation of PyVisML (https://code.google.com/p/pyvisml/) and CROC (http://swami.wustl.edu/CROC/), as
well as a partial implementation of ConsensusCluster (https://code.google.com/p/consensus-cluster/).

PyVisML and ConsensusCluster are copyright 2009 and 2013 Michael Seiler
CROC is copyright 2014 S. Joshua Swamidass

The output of this program is a VisML XML file suitable for visualization using the VisANT network-visualization and analysis
platform.

INSTALLATION
------------

This product is designed to work without installation. Simply unzip it into a separate directory.

Crosstalker is then invoked from a working directory by pointing python to this unzipped location.

RUNNING
-------

In order to run Crosstalker, create a working directory and cd into it. Then run python /path/to/ctalk.py [OPTIONS].

See ctalk.py --help for details.

At the present time, a copy of a functional linkage network (FLN) and a python-pickled dictionary object containing pathway
definitions is required by Crosstalker. Because of github file restrictions, you can obtain the examples used in the paper from my
Dropbox, or by sending me an email.

Dropbox links:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/467624/FLN_hsa.txt.gz

Both should be ungzipped before using.

RESULTS
-------

This program outputs a pathway-pathway crosstalk network suitable for use with the VisANT software platform (visant.bu.edu). A
recent version of VisANT (4.3 or later) is required to view the network properly.
